NAME

    Log::Any::Adapter::Coderef - arbitrary code handlers for Log::Any
    messages

SYNOPSIS

     use JSON::MaybeUTF8 qw(:v1);
     use Log::Any::Adapter qw(Coderef) => sub {
      my ($data) = @_;
      STDERR->print(encode_json_utf8($data) . "\n");
     };

DESCRIPTION

    Provides support for sending log messages through a custom sub, for
    cases when you want to do something that isn't provided by existing
    adapters.

    Currently takes a single $code parameter as a callback. This will be
    called for every log message, passing a hashref which has the following
    keys:

      * epoch - current time, as a floating-point epoch value

      * severity - log level, e.g. info or debug

      * message - the formatted log message

      * host - current hostname

      * pid - current process ID ("$$" in perlvar)

      * stack - arrayref of stacktrace entries, see caller

    Additional keys may be added in future, for example structured data.
